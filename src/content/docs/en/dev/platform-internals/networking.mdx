title: Networking Architecture
---

YAMP uses a modern client-server networking architecture, diverging from the peer-to-peer model used by GTA Online and FiveM. All game state and logic are managed authoritatively by the server.

## Synchronization

Entity and event synchronization is handled through efficient state replication. Clients receive timely updates only for relevant entities, based on their stream range and visibility. 

The system prioritizes low-latency updates for critical actions (such as player movement or combat), while optimizing bandwidth for less time-sensitive state changes.

## Developer Experience

YAMP exposes a streamlined networking API, allowing developers to build multiplayer features without needing to understand low-level networking protocols. This API handles:

* Entity updates and replication
* Remote events and data transfer
* Streaming relevance filtering

The result is a fast, scalable foundation for secure and responsive gameplay systems.
