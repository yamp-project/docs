title: Server Authority Explained
---

YAMP operates with server-side authority, meaning the server is the single source of truth for game state and actions. Unlike peer-to-peer systems (such as GTA Online or FiveM), which rely heavily on the base game's netcode, YAMP does not.

## How it Works

Client actions are treated as inputs or requests. The server receives these inputs, validates them against game rules and current state, executes valid actions, and then replicates the resulting changes to relevant clients.

## Benefits

This model prevents many common cheats found in P2P systems, such as:

* Clients illegitimately taking control of entities (e.g., vehicles owned by others)
* Clients manipulating their own state (e.g., god mode, teleporting)
* Exploits tied to the base game's original netcode

:::info[Example: Vehicle Control]
In peer-to-peer systems, a client might request ownership of a vehicle. If granted (even illegitimately), they can manipulate sync data â€” potentially causing it to explode while someone else is driving. In YAMP, the server always retains control. A client may request to enter or control a vehicle, but the server verifies and executes the action.

## Developer Impact

* **Security**: Your server is inherently more resistant to client-side exploits.
* **Logic**: Most gameplay logic lives on the server. Client code handles input, UI, and requests.
* **Latency**: Server validation adds a slight delay to some actions, depending on connection quality. YAMP's networking layer minimizes this delay for latency-sensitive features.

While server authority increases reliance on server performance and network stability, it is essential for building secure and fair multiplayer environments.
