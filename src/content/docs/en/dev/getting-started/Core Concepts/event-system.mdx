title: Event System
---

YAMP uses a flexible event system to enable communication and reactions across different parts of the game. This system facilitates communication:

* Between different resources on the server
* Between the server and clients
* Between different resources on the client

## Purpose

Events decouple game logic and enable reactive design. Instead of one script directly calling another, it can trigger an event. Any interested script can subscribe to that event and respond independently.

## Types of Events

* **Built-in Events**  
  YAMP emits events for common actions such as player connect/disconnect, entity creation and destruction, damage, and entities entering or leaving a client’s stream range.

* **Custom Events**  
  Developers can define and trigger their own events to represent gameplay milestones or facilitate communication between custom systems.

* **Client–Server Events**  
  Events can be triggered on the server and sent to specific clients or all clients. Similarly, clients can emit events to the server. These client-to-server events should always be validated on the server for security.

## Usage

YAMP’s event API provides functions to:

* **Subscribe (`On`)** — Register a handler function for a specific event
* **Trigger (`Emit`)** — Fire an event, optionally passing data with it
* **Unsubscribe (`Off`)** — Remove a previously registered handler

Refer to the [Event Handling Guide](../../developer-guides/event-handling.md) and the API reference for detailed usage and a list of available events.
