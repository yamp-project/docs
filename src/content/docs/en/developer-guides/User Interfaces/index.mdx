YAMP offers multiple options for building user interfaces, allowing developers to choose based on performance needs and UI complexity.

## Supported UI Solutions

* **Ultralight**  
  The primary high-performance option, ideal for lightweight and responsive UI elements where efficiency is critical.  
  See: [Ultralight Guide](./ultralight-guide.md)

* **CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework)**  
  A feature-rich alternative based on Chromium, well-suited for complex UIs that resemble full web apps. It offers robust HTML/CSS/JS support but comes with higher performance overhead.  
  See: [CEF Guide](./cef-guide.md)

## Choosing the Right UI Solution

Each solution is designed to integrate seamlessly with YAMPâ€™s scripting runtimes. When choosing a UI backend, consider the following:

* **Performance impact**
* **Ease of development**
* **Feature set (HTML/CSS/JS capabilities)**
* **Cross-platform compatibility**

For guidance on structuring and optimizing UI across both options, refer to the [UI Best Practices](./ui-best-practices.md).
