title: Runtimes
---

YAMP supports multiple scripting runtimes, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their preferences and project needs.

## Officially Supported Runtimes

* **Lua**  
  A lightweight, embeddable scripting language known for its simplicity and performance. Ideal for rapid development and game logic.

* **JavaScript (JS)**  
  A widely-used, versatile language with a large ecosystem. Suitable for general scripting tasks, including UI integration.

* **TypeScript (TS)**  
  A statically typed superset of JavaScript, offering improved tooling, safety, and maintainability. Recommended for larger or more complex projects.

All official runtimes expose APIs to interact with YAMP platform features such as entities, events, networking, and native functions.

## Extensibility via C SDK

Beyond the official runtimes, YAMP offers a core **C SDK** that exposes low-level platform APIs. This enables the community to:

* Add support for other languages (e.g., Python, Rust, Go)
* Build custom runtimes with specialized behavior or integrations

This extensibility allows YAMP to evolve as a community-driven platform.
