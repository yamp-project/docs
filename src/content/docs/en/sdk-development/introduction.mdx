title: Introduction to the C SDK
---

YAMP provides a core C Software Development Kit (SDK) for advanced users and platform contributors.

## Purpose

The C SDK exposes low-level APIs within the YAMP platform. Its primary goals are:

1. **Creating Custom Runtimes**  
   Support additional scripting languages beyond the officially supported Lua and Javascript/TypeScript (e.g., Python, Rust, Go).

2. **Developing Platform Extensions**  
   Build native modules or plugins that integrate directly with the YAMP core, enabling features or optimizations that are not possible through scripting alone.

## Audience

This SDK is intended for developers experienced in C or C++ and familiar with low-level systems programming. It is **not required** for typical server development using Lua or TypeScript.

## Capabilities

With the C SDK, you can access and interact with:

* Core event loops
* Entity management
* Native function invocation
* Networking internals (to a limited extent)
* Resource lifecycle hooks

Refer to the following guides for implementation details:

* [Building Custom Runtimes](./building-custom-runtimes.md)
* [Platform Extension Guides](./platform-extension-guides.md)
