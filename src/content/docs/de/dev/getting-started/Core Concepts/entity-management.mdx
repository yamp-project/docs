title: Entity Management
---

In **YAMP**, the server centrally manages all dynamic entities in the game world. This includes:

* **Players**
* **Vehicles**
* **Pedestrians (Peds)**
* **Objects**

## Server Control

All entity actions — including creation, deletion, and state changes (such as position, rotation, health, model, and metadata) — are authoritatively controlled by the server.

Client scripts cannot directly create or globally modify networked entities.

## Streaming

Clients receive updates only for entities within their relevance radius (often called the "stream distance"). This improves both performance and bandwidth by ensuring each client only receives data about nearby entities. The server determines which entities are relevant to each client.

## Developer API

YAMP provides APIs (available in **Lua** and **TypeScript**) for server-side scripts to:

* Create and destroy entities
* Get and set entity properties (position, model, health, etc.)
* Query the state of entities
* Attach custom logic and metadata to entities

Client-side scripts can:

* Read properties of streamed entities
* Perform local effects such as visuals or audio

However, client scripts cannot modify the authoritative state of any networked entity.
